# RAG_Pipeline_Chatbot
This workflow monitors a Google Drive folder, downloads new files, splits text into chunks, generates embeddings with OpenAI, stores them in Pinecone, and enables retrieval through an AI Agent connected to a chat model. Users can query documents, and the system returns accurate, context-aware answers automatically.
